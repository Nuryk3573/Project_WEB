                    <p>Kazakhstan is a multinational and multicultural country. Its vast territory had not only nations mixed, but also there has been interpenetration of different cultures. A special, Kazakhstan’s culture has developed.

                        However, despite such a mixture of cultures, each nation of Kazakhstan carefully preserves its cultural traditions and customs. Kazakhs have a great number of traditions, which are passed down from generation to generation, and are gladly adopted by young people.</p>

                Such an attitude to the guests formed in ancient times. Accidental travelers, as well as guests, were always welcomed with hospitality and treated to the most delicious food.
